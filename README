Current repository structure:

master: base branch that has common tools and infrastructure

runoff: development specific to runoff task, i.e., adding new surface runoff options

refactor: initial refactor of Noah-MP soil water routines to define structure for further refactor expansion

=========================================

This repository has two purposes:

1. provide a quick testing enviornment for incorporating new options related to the NWM v3.0 Runoff Task

2. provide a sandbox for initial refactor of soilwater code including reproducibility tests

=========================================

Steps to running model:

1. Configure environment and build

  a. (optional) create your own environment file in the config directory, need Fortran compiler and NetCDF library 
  
  b. ./configure
  
    if you didn't create your own environment file, choose any option and manually set compiler and library paths
  
  c. make
  
2. Change setup in namelist.input in run/

3. Run soil_moisture.exe in run/

=========================================

Reproducibility tests (located in test/reproduce):

1. run_namelist_combos.perl

  a. change testname, then run
  
2. compare_results.perl

  a. change names to compare, then run, will produce report in reports/
